# Introduction

# Problem Statement: 

Approximately 100 million women use Flo app and similar apps to track period and other aspects of their lives, companies like Flo have been found to sell women's menstrual cycles data to companies like Google Facebook for targeted marketing, profiting off this data. Our goal is to store the data in a decentralized platform like IPFS, encrypted end to end. The project Coral gives the power of data ownership back to the woman to share their data for research or marketing and profit from it if they so choose.

There are several apps that cater to women in general. From forums, weight-loss, period/ovulation tracker, fertility tracker, diet tracker, story sharing of self-growth, to childbirth experiences. Coral becomes a go-to-go wellness app that combines all tracker into one with essential features that caters to every woman without having multiple apps.

# About Coral Reef :

Coral Reef is a social network  that is being  built on the blockchain in the form of a Decentralized Application (DApp) where women from all walks of life can converge to develop relationships beyond the borders of their country.

We believe that women should be able to track their health and decide on healthy choices through a series of trackers to support their daily lives. Hence, the CoralApp, built on this principle, is a hybrid DApp powered by blockchain technology to strengthen and improve how we use applications and how data is controlled and sold on the current web infrastructure.

Project Goal

The Coral Reef is designed to empower women through a series of offerings and app features to enhance our daily lives while connecting every user to other women who also believe in our collective strength. Reef is for every woman who is interested in being part of a community larger than themselves.

# Project Description

The Coral Reef DApp is designed for a global social experience! The combination of frequently used applications with a forum that is set to encourage participation by design, strengthened by end-to- end encryption is poised to deliver a highly functional product such incentivized content creation, ecosystem autonomous governance, and the use of blockchain storage to ensure data stored is not sold on the market without the concept and incentive to the data owner.

With all the daily activities women try to juggle in a day while trying to keep their crowns fixed on their heads, it has become even more important to consolidate areas that are possible (considering that even supermarkets want you to download their apps too). We are working on a product that is easy to use and less complex than the physics homework or the 10-month-old that crawls off as fast as she can during a diaper change.

 it is incredibly beautiful, It has different types of objects, animals of different shapes and sizes, personalities, and age. Yet, they converge in this area and dwell to collectively form a beautiful ecosystem that marvels us all.

The Coral DApp will be a place that will become a household name for events related to self-development, growth, and positivity. A place where parents will be happy to send their teenager daughters to learn from other cultures and women of professional and entrepreneurial backgrounds.

# Value

* Data protection on the blockchain with end to end encryption
* Incentivated data offering that puts the control and benefit of sharing data back to the data owner.
* In addition to these 2 main values, the dApp will include  the following

* A marketplace that allows users to open up their own shop and sell to other women. This gives them a chance to build their own wealth while paying a small fee to the platform.
* A community chat form with anonymous chat for freedom of expression.
* Contributors in the ecosystem will also be rewarded with tokens called Seashells (CRL)
* Main track apps are: A period tracking, Wellness tracker, nutrition tracker, and a pregnancy tracker
* An expert Corner designed to be a plugin for health professionals and counselors to schedule appointments for women looking for virtual consultations for take-ins and get medical advice from body image to fertility discussions and options to cater to the $44.8 Billion global medical tourism business as of 2019.

# Deliverables
